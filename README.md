<h1>Ultimate SOC Lab </h1>

<p>This README provides an overview of the architecture and components of the Ultimate SOC (Security Operations Center) Lab. The lab is designed to emulate a real-world SOC environment with a focus on cybersecurity monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.</p>

<h2>Network Diagram</h2>
<p>The network diagram illustrates the flow of data and the interaction between various components in the SOC Lab. Below is an explanation of each component and its role in the lab.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<h3>1. Authentik (IDP - Identity Provider)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Authentik serves as the Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and access control within the SOC environment. It handles user authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and role-based access control (RBAC).</li>
  <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Secure authentication for users accessing the lab resources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Netbird (VPN)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Netbird provides a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure, encrypted remote access to the lab environment. It ensures that all communications within the lab are protected and private.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Remote users connect securely to the lab via VPN, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Wazuh (EDR/SIEM)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Wazuh functions as both an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool and a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. It collects, analyzes, and correlates security data across endpoints and systems to detect threats and provide real-time alerts.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Continuous monitoring of endpoints for potential security incidents and threat detection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. IRIS (Threat Intelligence)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> IRIS is integrated into the SOC lab as a threat intelligence platform, providing insights into potential threats, vulnerabilities, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). It helps in enriching security data with contextual threat information.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Correlation of security events with threat intelligence feeds to improve detection and response capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Graylog (SIEM)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Graylog is another SIEM solution used in the SOC lab for log management and analysis. It provides a centralized location for collecting, storing, and querying logs from various systems within the lab.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Log analysis and alerting based on predefined rules and conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Operating Systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Standard Windows operating system used as an endpoint or workstation within the lab.</li>
  <li><strong>Windows Server:</strong> A server-based operating system for hosting services and applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Ubuntu:</strong> A Linux-based operating system used within the lab, often for servers or specialized security tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. SOCfortress Copilot</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> SOCfortress Copilot assists in automating the SOC workflow by integrating with the existing security tools and helping with alert triage, threat hunting, and response automation.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Streamlines security operations by reducing manual effort and improving response times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Network Flow</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> Represents a simulated threat actor attempting to breach the SOC lab environment. The attacker interacts with the lab via the internet, allowing for testing of defenses and security controls.</li>
  <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Provides connectivity between the external attacker and the internal lab network.</li>
  <li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN):</strong> Secures all traffic entering the lab environment from external sources.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal Lab Environment:</strong> Consists of various systems and tools that are protected and monitored by the SOC infrastructure. All data and communications within this environment are secured by the VPN and authenticated via Authentik.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use the Lab</h2>

<h3>1. Connecting to the Lab</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use Netbird VPN to securely connect to the lab environment from an external network.</li>
  <li>Authenticate using Authentik to gain access to the lab resources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Monitoring and Incident Response</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Monitor the environment using Wazuh and Graylog for real-time alerts and log analysis.</li>
  <li>Utilize IRIS for threat intelligence to investigate suspicious activity and correlate with known threats.</li>
  <li>Use SOCfortress Copilot to assist in incident response and automation tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Testing Security Controls</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Simulate attacks using the attacker role to test the efficacy of security controls in the lab.</li>
  <li>Analyze the response of the security tools and adjust configurations as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Ultimate SOC Lab is a powerful environment for practicing and refining cybersecurity skills. By integrating leading security tools and platforms, the lab provides a comprehensive ecosystem for monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. Use this lab to gain hands-on experience with modern security technologies and improve your SOC capabilities.</p>
